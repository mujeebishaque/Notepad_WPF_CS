# Notepad_WPF_CS
Custom Notepad made in WPF/C#. 

Written using a Third Party library called AvalonEdit. 
Most of the functionality is not coded by me rather copied and pasted from different sources. I just wrote the Front-end part
and some events. 
The Icon used in text-editor is not mine. I googled it and included it in my project. Rights are reserved to the owner. I don't own either 
icon nor library used in my project.


At the moment, it only provide syntax highlighting for C Sharp, C++ and Php programs.
It is fast and you can use it as your regular text editor or maybe a bettter C++ Text-Editor. It just looks nice tbh.

Requirements:
___
VS 2015

Any other library or thing to do before running this project?
No. Just download it, compile it, run it. 

# OR

Go to Debug folder, Run Notepad.exe from there.

Can i use it and add to it and make it my editor?
yes. Do what you want to do.

# Compile And Run Feature
Yeah, i added it today at 1/9/2018. Works fine but you need to have set global env. path in windows settings. It uses --std=C++14 flag by default. You can easily change the source and make it use --std=c++1z || 17;

# Extra Features?
it's not a feature but just an idea. Idk, i wanted to save compiler path in configuration file so i did. It finds the compiler in C directory, cygwin64 folder and put's the full path in configuration file which is located at current application directory.
Nothing fancy, no use but it was just for me to learn how to save configurations. 
# Note-to-self
I should rather use .json or application settings to save the settings.
Learn MVVM Pattern too. Code is so not readable in this format. Also, there is ZERO usage of LINQ which is bad.
