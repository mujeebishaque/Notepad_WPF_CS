# Notepad_WPF_CS
Custom Notepad made in WPF/C#. 

Written using a Third Party library called AvalonEdit. 
Most of the functionality is not coded by me rather copied and pasted from different sources. I just wrote the Front-end part
and some events. 
The Icon used in text-editor is not mine. I googled it and included it in my project. Rights are reserved to the owner. I don't own either 
icon nor library used in my project.


At the moment, it only provide syntax highlighting for C Sharp, C++ and Php programs.
It is fast and you can use it as your regular text editor or maybe a bettter C++ Text-Editor. It just looks nice tbh.
