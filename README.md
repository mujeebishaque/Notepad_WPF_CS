# Notepad_WPF_CS
Custom Notepad made in WPF/C#. 

Written using a Third Party library called AvalonEdit. 
Most of the functionality is not coded by me rather copied and pasted from different sources. I just wrote the Front-end part
and some events. 
The Icon used in text-editor is not mine. I googled it and included it in my project. Rights are reserved to the owner. I don't own either 
icon nor library used in my project.


At the moment, it only provide syntax highlighting for C Sharp programs.
It is fast and you can use it as your regular text editor. It just looks nice tbh.

Can i use it and add to it and make it my editor?
yes. Do what you want to do.

Will you be improving it further?
Yes. I need to add certain more features and want to support many other languages like php, c++, python etc.
